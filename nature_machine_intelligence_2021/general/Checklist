Ensure that the model_group_k table exists: CREATE TABLE {schema/rschema}.model_adjustment_group_k_{demo_col} AS (SELECT 'h' as model_group_id, '2011-06-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP as train_end_time, 'h' as demo_value, 5 as group_k FROM {any table})
    Then truncate it
Ensure that the all_end_times table exists: CREATE TABLE {schema}.all_end_times as SELECT '2011-06-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP as train_end_time FROM {anytable} then truncate and insert the dates you are actually using
